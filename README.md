Each time you work on something in the project, you must do the following steps.

1. Navigate to the directory of your remote repository using
    - `cd {{folder-name}}`
2. create a branch separate from the main branch. To do this, in the terminal type
    - `git branch {{branch-name}}`
    - The `branch-name` should correlate to the feature you are working on

3. Checkout the branch you created using
    - `git checkout {{branch-name}}`
4. Save the files you worked on in the remote directory you are working in.
5. Add the files you worked on to a branch using
    - `git add .`
6. Commit the files to your branch using a commit message using
    - `git commit -m "{{your commit message explaining your changes}}"`
7. Push the changes to the working directory using
    - `git push`
8. Create a pull request to merge with the main branch in github.
